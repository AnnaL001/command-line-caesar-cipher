# Command Line Caesar Cipher

#### A Command Line Java application that implements a caesar cipher which is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places also known as a key, down the alphabet(A-Z).

## Description

The Java application makes use of the caesar cipher encryption algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text input. Encryption/Decryption is done using a key(1-25) that determines which letter down/up the alphabet will replace a letter in the text input. The application also contains JUnit tests that check that the backend logic is working as expected. That is, in the development of the application TDD(Test Driven Development) has been used alongside BDD(Behavior Driven Development).

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- Using a mobile device/laptop ensure you have access to stable internet connection
- To access the Java application's code from your GitHub repository, you can fork the repository main's branch via the 'Fork' button.
- To access the Java application's code locally, you can clone the main branch or download the ZIP folder via the 'Code' button
- Once locally, you can view/run the Java application's code via a text editor(VS Code or Sublime Text) or an IDE(IntelliJ).

## Behavior Driven Development(BDD)
| **Behavior**                              | **Input Example**                           | **Output**                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| When key provided contains text instead of digits       | key = hi    | User receives feedback advising them to use digits(1 -25) for a key    |
| When one word is provided for encryption input            | input = Hello, key = 1            | output = Ifmmp     |
| When multiple words are provided for encryption input          | input = Hello World, key = 1   | output = Ifmmp Xpsme   |
| When one word is provided for decryption input | input = Ifmmp, key = 1          | output = Hello |
| When multiple words are provided for decryption input            | input = Ifmmp Xpsme, key = 1  | output = Hello World |
